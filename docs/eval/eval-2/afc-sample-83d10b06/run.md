# Run — Chief trial

Manual Calc chat trial. Not wired into `dataset.py` / `run_eval`.

## Setup

1. From the repo root, start the headed helper **with `--launch`**. It **writes** `"chatbot.max_tool_rounds": 50` into `writeragent.json` and restores the previous value (or removes the key) on Enter / Ctrl-C. Do not edit the JSON by hand.

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/eval_2_headed.py --launch
   ```

   `--launch` copies **only** `fixtures/Population v2.ods` into `$TMP/writeragent-eval2-afc` (override with `--trial-dir`) and opens that copy. Prompt, rubric, gold, notes, and the xlsx / min-range siblings stay outside that folder so `document_research` cannot list them. Do **not** open `fixtures/` or this task directory. Trailing args run a command as the session (`-- soffice --calc workbook.ods`) and skip staging — use that only if the workbook is already in a clean dir. Confirm in the debug log: `Tool-calling loop START (max 50 rounds)`. Everyday chat stays at 15 after the helper exits.
2. Set the chat model to `openai/gpt-oss-120b:nitro`.
3. Paste the full contents of `prompt.writeragent.txt` as the user message. Do not paste `prompt.gdpval.txt`.

## After the run

Create `runs/<stamp>-gpt-oss-120b/` (example: `runs/20260906-1530-gpt-oss-120b/`) and save:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `prompt_used.txt` | Exact text sent (should match `prompt.writeragent.txt`) |
| `thinking_and_tools.md` | Model thinking plus tool calls |
| `final_workbook.ods` | Workbook after the agent finished (the staged trial-dir copy, not `fixtures/`) |
| `notes.txt` | Observer notes: failures, extra files created, rubric mismatches, timing |

Then score the saved workbook. Ready / STREAM_DONE is ignored — an empty Sample fails:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/eval_2_headed.py --score runs/<stamp>-gpt-oss-120b/final_workbook.ods
```

See [`rubric.eval2.md`](rubric.eval2.md). Leave gold under `gold/` and this `run.md` unchanged when adding a trial.
