# Impress AI headed findings: `inception/mercury-2.5` (space elevator)

**Status:** Findings + root-cause probe. **A**, **A2**, **D**, **C1**, **B**, **F**, and **E** landed (C2 not done).  
**Date:** 2026-09-16  
**Verdict:** **MIXED**  
**Related:** [impress-specialized-toolsets.md](impress-specialized-toolsets.md)  
**Verification:** Root cause and fix A confirmed with a native UNO probe (`tests/draw/test_placeholders_uno.py`) — see [Probe verification](#probe-verification-2026-09-16).

Exploratory headed play (not a formal eval harness). Goal was to see whether Impress chat on tip does a good job with a fast/cheap model, and where tools vs prompts vs model limits show up.

---

## Setup

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| Tip | `a3e0b2a1` (master after #778) |
| Extension | WriterAgent **debug** deploy (`make deploy`) |
| Model | **`inception/mercury-2.5` only** (OpenRouter; confirmed `used_model` in debug log) |
| Doc | New Impress presentation |
| Artifacts | Headed shots for this run lived on the box under `/workspace/impress-ai-explore/` (not committed — keeps git history lean). Debug log: same dir `writeragent_debug.log`. |

### Ops gotcha: LibreHarper + WriterAgent ChatPanel

With **LibreHarper** still installed alongside WriterAgent, opening the chat sidebar in Impress failed repeatedly:

```text
ChatPanel createContainerWindow returned no window
…/LibreHarper.oxt/Dialogs/ChatPanelDialog.xdl  exists=False
```

LO resolved the ChatPanel factory UI to the LibreHarper package path (no `ChatPanelDialog.xdl` there). Removing LibreHarper and keeping WriterAgent-only fixed the sidebar. Treat co-install ChatPanel ownership as a real footgun for headed Impress/Writer QA.

---

## Lead task

Ask chat to create a **multi-slide presentation about the space elevator**, then light follow-ups on the same deck (edit, structural add, one visual shape).

### Screenshots

Not in-repo (Keith: avoid bloating history). For this run they were on the box at `/workspace/impress-ai-explore/01-space-elevator-deck.png` … `04-visual.png`.


---

## What worked

| Task | Result |
|------|--------|
| Create multi-slide deck from prompt | **OK** — coherent title + bullet slides on the space elevator |
| Edit existing slide (title / body / bullet) | **OK** after an off-by-one correction |
| Structural `add_slide` | **OK** — ended at 5 slides |
| Visual shape | **OK** — `delegate_to_specialized_draw_toolset(domain="shapes")` → `shape_upsert` create rectangle, green fill, on page 0 |
| Model identity | Confirmed `inception/mercury-2.5` on OpenRouter for chat + nested specialist calls |

Mercury was fast enough for interactive headed play and did call tools (not only chat prose) once the run was unstuck.

---

## What failed / friction

### 1. Placeholder roles with `available: []`

Repeated tool errors of the form:

```json
{"status": "error", "code": "TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR",
 "message": "Placeholder 'title' not found.",
 "details": {"available": [], "tool_name": "set_placeholder_text", "doc_type": "impress"}}
```

Same pattern for `'body'`. Parallel `list_placeholders` often returned `count: 0` (or empty roles) until layout work / retries. The model then looped `set_placeholder_text` and `slide_layouts` delegate tasks.

**Code:** `plugin/draw/placeholders.py` (`list_placeholders`, `set_placeholder_text` — role lookup calls `_list_placeholders` and errors when role missing).  
**Layouts:** specialized domain `slide_layouts` via `plugin/draw/transitions.py` (`set_slide_layout` / `get_slide_layout`).  
**Add slide:** `plugin/draw/pages.py` (`add_slide`).

### 2. Slide / page index confusion

Off-by-one and “edit the wrong slide” behavior showed up in the headed run (agent report + thumbnail vs canvas mismatch in Fig. 2). Prompt/tool surface mixes conventions:

- Many Draw tools: **0-based** `page`
- `get_image`: **1-based** `page=N` at the time of the run (called out in [impress-specialized-toolsets.md](impress-specialized-toolsets.md) and the Draw system prompt) — **since aligned to 0-based**; see D

Mercury recovered, but burned turns.

### 3. Blank-ish / layout-incomplete slides

At least one slide looked empty in the pane / thumbnail while content existed elsewhere; layout reassignment was attempted when placeholders were missing. Default “add then fill by role” is fragile if the new page is not a title+body layout.

### 4. Model limits

- **No vision** for this model (`ModelCapability.NONE` in log) — `get_image` page renders are not useful for mercury-2.5.
- Initial turn sometimes answered generically before committing to tools (prompt already says “do not explain — do the operation”; still happened once).
- Prompt markets “polished, professional, and colorful” (`DEFAULT_DRAW_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `plugin/framework/prompts.py`) but the successful path was plain title + bullets + one rectangle — expectation mismatch more than a hard failure.

### 5. Stability note

No SEGV in the successful session. Early `UnoObjectError` storm was the LibreHarper ChatPanel path, not an Impress tool crash. No `assert_main_thread` fail observed as a sign-off blocker for the successful deck work.

---

## Diagnosis: tools vs prompts vs model

| Layer | Assessment |
|-------|------------|
| **Tools** | Core set is enough for create / edit / add / shapes. Weak spot is **placeholder discovery + layout coupling**: role-based `set_placeholder_text` fails hard when the slide has no named placeholders yet (`available: []`). |
| **Prompts** | Draw/Impress prompt lists tools and says verify `status='error'`, but does not hard-steer “always `list_placeholders` → use **index** if roles empty; set layout before fill.” “Colorful” steers ambition without a default visual recipe. |
| **Model (mercury-2.5)** | Adequate tool caller for this scoped play; weak at index/layout recovery; no vision. Not the main blocker vs placeholder/layout brittleness. |

## Probe verification (2026-09-16)

`tests/draw/test_placeholders_uno.py` is a native UNO probe (runs via `make test-uno FILTER=tests/draw/test_placeholders_uno.py`). It pins the headed failure and the A fix with assertions (default `text` layout has placeholders; role set works; `blank`/`none` stay empty).

| Step | Observed |
|------|----------|
| Fresh Impress doc | 1 slide, `Layout=0` |
| `add_slide` | new page idx 1 with **`Layout=20`** and **0 shapes** |
| `list_placeholders(page=1)` | `count: 0` |
| `set_placeholder_text(role="title")` | error `"Placeholder 'title' not found."`, `available: []` (exact headed failure) |
| `page.Layout = 1` (no event loop, no retry) | **2 shapes appear synchronously**: `[0] TitleTextShape`, `[1] OutlinerShape`, both `IsEmptyPresentationObject: true` |
| `list_placeholders` immediately after | `count: 2` |
| `set_placeholder_text` title / body | both `ok`; land on index 0 / 1; read back on the right shapes |

Takeaways that change the plan below:

1. **A is the root-cause fix and needs no refresh workaround.** `page.Layout = 1` instantiates the title/body placeholders synchronously. The earlier worry that placeholders only appear “after retries” is unfounded on this build — the retries were the model re-running layout work, not a settle delay.
2. **`insertNewByIndex` leaves `Layout=20` but no placeholder shapes.** So a fresh slide both lies to `get_slide_layout` (`two_column_and_object`) and gives role lookup nothing to find. Setting a layout on `add_slide` fixes both symptoms.
3. **Use `"text"` (id 1), not `"title"`, as the Impress content default.** In `_LAYOUTS`, `title`=0 is a title+subtitle title slide, `text`=1 is Title + Content (title + body outline), and `title_only`=10 is title only.
4. **Placeholder role/class tagging is effectively dead on this LibreOffice build.** `shape.ClassName` and `getPropertyValue("PresObj")` raise, and shape `Name` is empty, so `_list_placeholders` emits `{index, text}` with no `role`/`class`, and `_find_placeholder` matches only via strategy 3 (positional: first text = title, second = body). That is why title/body targeted correctly *after* layout, and why the errors were empty *before*.
5. **The broad `"Text"` pattern in `_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES["body"]` is latent, not this bug's cause.** It could mis-target the title only on builds that expose `ClassName`; keep it as hardening, not as the failure to chase.

## Possible solutions (detailed — options, not a mandate)

Each item is written so a later implementer can pick it up without re-deriving the headed run. Prefer small PRs; Keith will cut.

---

### A. Default layout on `add_slide` (tool behavior)

**Status:** Landed. `blank`/`none` skip Layout assignment — `_LAYOUTS["blank"]=11` still grows placeholders on this LO; `insertNewByIndex` is the empty page.

**Problem**

After `add_slide`, mercury immediately called `set_placeholder_text` with `role: "title"` / `"body"`. Tools returned:

```json
{"status": "error", "code": "TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR",
 "message": "Placeholder 'title' not found.",
 "details": {"available": [], "tool_name": "set_placeholder_text", "doc_type": "impress"}}
```

Same for `'body'`. Concurrent `list_placeholders` often reported `"count": 0` / empty list. The model then delegated `slide_layouts` repeatedly (“reassign text layout to slide N”) and re-tried `set_placeholder_text`, burning turns before content stuck.

**Where**

- `plugin/draw/pages.py` — `AddSlide.execute` → `DrawBridge.create_slide(...)` (no layout argument today; description is only “Inserts a new slide at index”)
- `plugin/draw/transitions.py` — `set_slide_layout` / `get_slide_layout`; layout name `"text"` (and peers) already exist in `_LAYOUTS` / `_LAYOUT_NAMES`
- Downstream consumer: `plugin/draw/placeholders.py` — `set_placeholder_text` / `_find_placeholder` / `_list_placeholders`

**Proposed change (concrete)**

1. Extend `add_slide` parameters with optional `layout` (string, Impress-only; default **`"text"`** = `_LAYOUTS["text"]`=1 = Title + Content / title+body). Do **not** use `"title"`: it is id 0, a title+subtitle title slide. Verified 2026-09-16.
2. After `create_slide`, if doc is Impress and layout is set (including the new default), set `page.Layout = _LAYOUTS[layout_name]` the same way `SetSlideLayout.execute` does. The placeholder shapes are created **synchronously** by the assignment (probe: `Layout=1` → 2 shapes with no event loop or retry), so no refresh/`processEvents` step is needed. Prefer extracting the assignment into a shared helper — e.g. `apply_slide_layout(page, name)` plus `layout_id(name)` — reused by both `AddSlide` and `SetSlideLayout`, rather than duplicating `page.Layout = _LAYOUTS[...]`.
3. Guard for Impress only (e.g. `hasattr(doc, "getPresentation")` or the `PresentationDocument` service check), since `add_slide` is shared with Draw and Draw must ignore `layout`.
4. Return in the tool result: `{"status":"ok","active_page_index":N,"layout":"text","placeholders_hint":"call list_placeholders on this page"}` so the model sees the layout was applied.
5. Keep an explicit escape hatch: `layout: "blank"` (accept `"none"` as an alias) to preserve today’s blank-page behavior for draw-heavy asks.

**Why this vs alternatives**

- **Verified.** The probe shows a fresh `add_slide` page has `Layout=20` and 0 shapes, `list_placeholders` returns 0, and role-set fails with `available: []`; one `page.Layout = 1` fixes all three synchronously.
- Fixes the failure **before** the first `set_placeholder_text`, so prompt-only steers (B) are less load-bearing.
- Reuses the existing layout map in `transitions.py` instead of inventing a second layout system; a shared helper keeps `AddSlide` and `SetSlideLayout` from drifting.
- Cheaper than teaching every model to always delegate `slide_layouts` first.

**Risk / tradeoff**

- Callers who expect a blank canvas after `add_slide` must pass `layout: "blank"`.
- Layout name strings must stay aligned with `_LAYOUTS` across LO versions (already a `set_slide_layout` concern).
- Draw documents must ignore `layout` (tool already shared Drawing+Presentation).
- Today a fresh page reports `Layout=20` (`two_column_and_object`) with 0 shapes, so any code or prompt that trusts `get_slide_layout` on a just-added slide is already wrong; pinning the layout fixes that too.

**Before / after tool sequence**

Before (observed pattern):

```text
add_slide()
set_placeholder_text(role=title, text=...)  → error available=[]
set_placeholder_text(role=body, text=...)   → error available=[]
delegate(slide_layouts, "assign text layout…")
list_placeholders / set_placeholder_text × N
```

After (intended; probe-confirmed shape of the result):

```text
add_slide()                    → ok, layout=text, active_page_index=k
list_placeholders(page=k)      → count=2 (index 0 title, index 1 body)
set_placeholder_text(role=title|body, page=k) → ok
```

Note: on the probe build the role/class labels were absent — `_list_placeholders` returned `{index, text}` only — but role lookup still worked via the positional fallback. Expect **indices**; treat `role` as best-effort, not guaranteed.

---

### A2. Fix placeholder role matching (`body` can match the title)

**Status:** Landed.

**Problem**

`_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES["body"]` includes the very broad `"Text"` pattern (`plugin/draw/placeholders.py:27`). In `_find_placeholder` strategy 1 the loop is shape-outer / candidate-inner (`placeholders.py:42-57`), so for `role="body"` on a slide whose first shape is `TitleTextShape`, `"text" in "titletextshape"` matches and the **title is returned as the body**. This is latent on the probe build (it never exposes `ClassName`, so strategy 1 does not fire) but is a real wrong-target bug on any build that does.

**Where**

- `plugin/draw/placeholders.py` — `_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES` (line 27), `_find_placeholder` strategy 1 (lines 42–57); `_list_placeholders` uses the same map for labels.

**Proposed change (concrete)**

- Drop `"Text"` from `_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES["body"]` (keep `"Outline"` / `"Body"`), **or** — preferred — replace substring-any-candidate matching with a class→role map evaluated in priority order (`TitleText`→title, `SubTitle`→subtitle, `Outliner`→body). A single map also removes the shape-order dependence in strategy 1.

**Why this vs alternatives**

- Cheapest hardening; position-only slides are unaffected.
- Complements A: A gives the slide a clean layout; A2 stops role lookup from choosing the wrong shape when class tags do exist.

**Risk / tradeoff**

- Changing `_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES` also changes `_list_placeholders` labels, so cover both with a unit test (class→role mapping needs no live doc).

**Before / after**

Before: `role="body"` can select the first `TitleTextShape`.  
After: class→role is deterministic by pattern priority, independent of shape order.

---

### B. Prompt + tool-description steer (no default behavior change)

**Status:** Landed. WORKFLOW `IMPRESS TEXT FILLS` + tighter placeholder/`add_slide` descriptions. Page reminder is **0-based** (aligned with D / #781), not the 1-based `get_image` wording below.

**Problem**

Same placeholder errors as A. The Draw/Impress system prompt (`DEFAULT_DRAW_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `plugin/framework/prompts.py`) already says “VERIFY … status='error'” and lists `list_placeholders` / `set_placeholder_text`, but does **not** say:

- always list before set-by-role;
- if `available` is empty, set layout then retry;
- prefer **index** when roles are missing;
- remind 0-based `page` vs 1-based `get_image`.

Mercury still looped role-based sets.

**Where**

- `plugin/framework/prompts.py` — `DEFAULT_DRAW_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` (WRITE / WORKFLOW bullets ~tools list)
- Tool `description` strings in `plugin/draw/placeholders.py` (`ListPlaceholders`, `SetPlaceholderText`, `GetPlaceholderText`)
- Optionally one line in `plugin/draw/pages.py` `AddSlide.description`

**Proposed change (concrete)**

Add a short WORKFLOW bullet block, roughly:

```text
IMPRESS TEXT FILLS:
1. Prefer list_placeholders(page=N) before set_placeholder_text.
2. If count=0 or set_placeholder_text returns available=[], call
   delegate_to_specialized_draw_toolset(domain="slide_layouts",
     task="set layout 'text' on page N") then list_placeholders again.
3. If roles are missing but indices exist, set_placeholder_text(index=i, text=…).
4. page on these tools is 0-based; get_image page= is 1-based.
```

Tighten tool descriptions similarly, e.g. `set_placeholder_text`: “Prefer index from list_placeholders when role lookup fails; empty available means wrong layout, not a missing argument.”

**Why this vs alternatives**

- Zero runtime behavior change; safe first experiment.
- Documents the recovery path the headed run eventually stumbled into.
- Does not replace A if models ignore instructions (mercury sometimes did).

**Risk / tradeoff**

- Prompt size grows (Draw prompt is already long).
- Models can still ignore steers; empty layouts remain possible without A/C.
- Over-steering may push unnecessary `slide_layouts` delegates when roles already work.

**Before / after**

Before: model assumes `role=title` always works on a fresh slide.  
After: model’s first write path is list → (optional layout) → set by role or index.

---

### C. Richer `set_placeholder_text` errors + optional shape fallback (tool)

**Status:** **C1 landed.** C2 not done.

**Problem**

Error payload was:

```text
Placeholder 'title' not found.   details.available = []
```

That is true but **not actionable**: it does not say “slide has no presentation placeholders; try set_slide_layout('text')” or “shapes exist as TitleTextShape/OutlinerShape — use index / get_draw_tree.” In the successful run’s document snapshot, content often appeared as `TitleTextShape` / `OutlinerShape` even when role lookup failed — `_list_placeholders` only includes shapes with `getString`, and role tagging depends on `ClassName` patterns in `_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES`.

The probe confirmed the mechanism: before layout the slide has **zero** shapes, so `available` is genuinely empty (not a lookup failure); after layout it has `TitleTextShape` + `OutlinerShape`, but `ClassName`/`PresObj` raise and `Name` is empty on this build, so no `role`/`class` is ever attached and `_find_placeholder` resolves by position only. That means C1's hint is the main payoff here, and C2 must not assume clean class tags exist.

**Where**

- `plugin/draw/placeholders.py`
  - `_find_placeholder` / `_list_placeholders` / `_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES`
  - `SetPlaceholderText.execute` error branch (~line 213): `return self._tool_error("Placeholder '%s' not found." % role, available=_list_placeholders(page))`

**Proposed change (concrete)** — two tiers; implement one or both:

**C1 — Error shape only (safer)**

When role miss and `available` empty, return e.g.:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR",
  "message": "Placeholder 'title' not found on this slide.",
  "details": {
    "available": [],
    "hint": "Slide may lack a text layout. Call set_slide_layout (or delegate domain=slide_layouts) with layout='text', then list_placeholders.",
    "suggest_layout": "text",
    "shape_text_count": 0,
    "tool_name": "set_placeholder_text"
  }
}
```

If `_list_placeholders` is empty but `get_draw_tree`-style text shapes exist, include `fallback_indices: [{index, class, name}]` in details (read-only hint, no write).

**C2 — Optional write fallback (more aggressive)**

New parameter `fallback: "none"|"text_shapes"` (default `"none"`). When role miss and fallback enabled (or always for chat caller), write to first/second text shape by the same positional heuristic already in `_find_placeholder` strategy 3 — but only if those shapes exist. Or map `TitleTextShape` → title, `OutlinerShape` → body by `ClassName` even when not tagged as PresObj roles.

**Why this vs alternatives**

- C1 makes B’s recovery path obvious in the tool result the model already checks; the probe shows the empty `available` is truthful (“no placeholders yet”), so a `suggest_layout: "text"` hint is exactly the missing link.
- C2 matches how Impress often stores text after partial layout (shapes without clean role tags) — and the probe shows role/class tags are unavailable on this build, so positional/text-shape fallback is doing the real work already.
- Complements A: A prevents empty layouts; C handles leftover blank/wrong-layout slides.

**Risk / tradeoff**

- C2 can overwrite the wrong text box on complex slides (logos, footers).
- Expanding `_PLACEHOLDER_ROLES` / ClassName matching needs unit tests against real Impress pages.
- Larger error payloads increase token use slightly.

**Before / after**

Before: `available: []` → model retries same role call.  
After (C1): error names `suggest_layout` → one layout call → list → set.  
After (C2): role miss still writes outline/title shape when present → fewer layout round-trips.

---

### D. Index hygiene (schemas + prompt + catalog)

**Status:** Landed for the oddball. Do not flip the world to 1-based — model-facing `get_image(page=…)` is **0-based** (first page/slide = 0), same as `list_pages` / `add_slide` / `set_placeholder_text`. Writer `jumpToPage` still converts `page + 1` inside the render helper; Draw/Impress uses `getByIndex(page)` directly.

**Problem**

Headed run showed off-by-one / wrong-slide edits (edit intended slide 2, wrong active page; thumbnail vs canvas lag). Model-facing text mixes:

- Most Draw/Impress tools: **`page` = 0-based** (`list_pages`, `add_slide`, `set_placeholder_text`, `get_draw_tree`, shapes `page`, …)
- `get_image`: **`page=N` is 1-based** (first page is 1) — already noted in `docs/draw/impress-specialized-toolsets.md` and the Draw prompt

Mercury has no vision, so `get_image` was less used, but index confusion still hit `set_placeholder_text` / `set_active_page` / specialist `page` args (shapes specialist was told active index 4 while creating on page 0 for the green box — that part was intentional, but the mismatch in prompt context is easy to misread).

**Where**

- Parameter descriptions on tools in `plugin/draw/*.py` and `plugin/writer/get_image.py` (or image tool module)
- `plugin/framework/prompts.py` Draw template TOOLS list
- Human catalog: `docs/draw/impress-specialized-toolsets.md` §2.1

**Proposed change (concrete)**

1. Standardize every `page` description to start with either `0-based slide/page index` or `1-based page number (get_image only)`.
2. In the Draw system prompt TOOLS section, one bold line: “Unless a tool says 1-based, page is 0-based. `get_image` page is 1-based.”
3. Optional non-breaking alias later: accept `page_1based` only on `get_image` — **do not** rename `page` on core tools in a first pass (too much churn).

**Why this vs alternatives**

- Cheapest fix for a class of wrong-slide edits.
- Does not require API renames if limited to description/prompt text.

**Risk / tradeoff**

- Description-only fixes are soft; models still err.
- Renaming parameters would break existing evals/prompts — avoid unless intentional versioning.

**Before / after**

Before: model treats “slide 2” as `page=2` (third slide).  
After: descriptions + prompt make “slide 2 → page=1” explicit; fewer wrong `set_placeholder_text` targets.

---

### E. ChatPanel XDL / factory ownership when LibreHarper co-installed (framework)

**Status:** Landed as **manifest/build strip** (Keith: not XDL pin, not stub dialog). Harper `META-INF/manifest.xml` registers only the proofreader + Linguistic XCU. Build denylist + `test_libreharper_oxt.py` forbid `ChatPanelFactory` / `WriterAgentDeck` / `ChatPanelDialog` / `Factories.xcu` / `Sidebar.xcu` / `panel_factory.py`. Grammar registration is unchanged.

**Problem**

With LibreHarper + WriterAgent both installed, opening the Impress chat sidebar failed in a loop:

```text
[RICH-LIFECYCLE] createContainerWindow returned no window
url=…/LibreHarper.oxt/Dialogs/ChatPanelDialog.xdl
xdl_path=… exists=False
UnoObjectError: ChatPanel createContainerWindow returned no window
```

Factory URL resolved into the **LibreHarper** uno package tree, which has no `ChatPanelDialog.xdl`. WriterAgent’s copy exists at `…/WriterAgent.oxt/Dialogs/ChatPanelDialog.xdl`. Removing LibreHarper fixed the sidebar.

**Where**

- `plugin/chatbot/panel_factory.py` — `XDL_PATH = "Dialogs/ChatPanelDialog.xdl"`, `ChatPanelFactory`, `ChatPanelElement.getRealInterface` (raises the UnoObjectError above)
- Extension registration / `get_extension_url` (or equivalent) used to resolve XDL against the **active** package id
- LibreHarper slim OXT build (`scripts/build_libreharper_oxt.py` / manifest) — may still register overlapping UI element factory IDs or share implementation names

**Proposed change (concrete)** — pick one primary guard:

1. **Resolve XDL via WriterAgent extension id always** for ChatPanel (pin `org.extension.writeragent` when locating `Dialogs/ChatPanelDialog.xdl`), ignoring which package won factory registration; or
2. **LibreHarper must not register `ChatPanelFactory` / WriterAgentDeck UI** — strip those from the Harper manifest so only WriterAgent owns the sidebar; or
3. Ship a stub `ChatPanelDialog.xdl` in LibreHarper that redirects/errors clearly (weakest).

Also: log the resolved extension id + absolute XDL path at WARNING when `createContainerWindow` returns null (makes the next co-install failure obvious in `writeragent_debug.log`).

**Why this vs alternatives**

- Unblocks headed Impress/Writer QA when both products are installed (common on this box during Harper + WA work).
- Orthogonal to placeholder quality but was a hard blocker before the space-elevator run.

**Risk / tradeoff**

- Pinning WriterAgent id breaks a hypothetical Harper-only chat UI if that ever ships.
- Manifest stripping must stay in the LibreHarper build so it does not regress.

**Before / after**

Before: co-install → sidebar dead → no Impress AI.  
After: sidebar loads WriterAgent XDL regardless of Harper presence (or Harper simply does not claim ChatPanel).

---

### F. Model choice for visual / layout QA (process, not code)

**Status:** Landed the prompt-only fix: when the selected chat model has **no vision**, omit the `get_image` TOOLS bullet from the Draw/Impress system prompt (reuse `chat_text_model_has_native_vision`; fail-open). No two-model workflow.

**Problem**

Log showed `has_native_vision: model='inception/mercury-2.5' … vision=False`. Prompt advertises `get_image` for layout verification; mercury cannot use those PNGs. Visual quality stayed “title + bullets + one rectangle” despite “polished, colorful” prompt wording.

**Where**

- Process / eval choice (OpenRouter model id)
- Prompt claim in `DEFAULT_DRAW_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` about `get_image`
- Optional: UI model picker defaults for Impress sessions

**Proposed change (concrete)**

- Keep **mercury-2.5** for cheap structural smoke (create/edit/add_slide).
- For polish / layout verification headed passes, use a **vision-capable** model and actually call `get_image(page=N)` after edits.
- Optionally soften the Draw prompt when the selected model has no vision: omit or gate the `get_image` bullet (needs a small prompt assembly hook — only if worth it).

**Why this vs alternatives**

- Does not fix placeholder bugs; avoids false expectations that mercury will “see” slides.
- Matches the tool surface already documented in impress-specialized-toolsets.md.

**Risk / tradeoff**

- Higher cost for vision models.
- Two-model workflow is easy to forget in casual play.

---

### Suggested cut order (still Keith’s call)

1. **A** — landed: default `text` layout on Impress `add_slide`; probe file asserts.  
2. **A2** — landed: class→role map so `role="body"` cannot select the title.  
3. **C1** — landed: actionable `available: []` error (`hint`, `suggest_layout: "text"`).  
4. **B** — landed: list-then-set / layout-retry / prefer-index / 0-based page steer.  
5. **D** — landed: `get_image` page is 0-based (not a 1-based world flip).  
6. **E** — landed: LibreHarper must not register ChatPanelFactory / WriterAgentDeck UI.  
7. **F** — landed: omit `get_image` from the Draw prompt when the model has no vision.  
8. **C2** — still deferred; only if A+A2+C1 still leave TitleTextShape/OutlinerShape gaps.  

No mega-PR implied. A and the probe assertions belong together so the fix is actually pinned.

## Code map (quick)

| Concern | Path |
