"""Process-wide weak map of open sidebar panels keyed by RuntimeUID.

A1 peer messaging looks up the target ``SendButtonListener`` by the peer
document's uid. This is a production registry (not the debug ``WeakSet`` in
``panel_factory``, which is gated / stripped in release).

``panel_factory`` registers after ``_wire_buttons``. The peer tool reads this
module only — it must not import ``panel_factory`` or ``panel`` (cycle:
``CommonModule`` → tool → ``panel`` → ``get_tools()``).
