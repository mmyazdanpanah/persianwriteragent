"""Core get_image tool — return an embedded image as a real (viewable) image.

Lazy image perception (see docs/images/recognition-multimodal-LLMs.md and the Keith/Augusto design):
b64 is stripped from get_document_content by default, so a model never pays vision tokens up front.
When it actually needs to SEE one image, it calls get_image, which returns that single picture as a
native MCP image content block (only then are vision tokens spent). One self-documenting tool, by
graphic name, by the current selection, or page=<n> to render a whole page (_render_page_png below).
On Draw/Impress, page=N is the vision screenshot (0-based, same as list_pages / get_draw_tree); get_draw_tree remains the structure read.
