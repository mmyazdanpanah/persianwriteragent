"""direct_flat and direct_discovery must expose the same capabilities.

The two MCP exposure modes reach the specialized tools by different routes: direct_flat lists
them straight from the registry, direct_discovery advertises a domain catalog that find_tools
expands. Nothing kept the two in agreement, and they drifted — extract_structure_from_image was
listed and callable in direct_flat while no catalog domain mentioned it, so a model driving
direct_discovery could not know it existed.

The invariant tested here: every tool direct_flat lists belongs to a domain the discovery catalog
offers. Not "every declared domain is catalogued" — some are hidden from both on purpose — but
that the two modes hide the same things.
